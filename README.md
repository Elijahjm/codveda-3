# Minimalist Celebration Counter

A clean, functional, and interactive counter application built with **Vanilla JavaScript**. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, state persistence, and integration with third-party animation libraries.



## Features

- **Persistence:** Uses `localStorage` to remember your count even after refreshing the page.
- **Smart Logic:** Prevents the counter from going below zero.
- **Dynamic Styling:** The UI reacts to the count (Red at 0, Green at 10+).
- **Celebration:** Integrated `canvas-confetti` to celebrate every milestone of 10.
- **Minimalist Design:** Focused on typography, spacing, and smooth transitions.

##  Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Custom properties and transitions for a modern feel.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Logic, Event Listeners, and Web Storage API.
- **Canvas-Confetti:** High-performance particle animations.
